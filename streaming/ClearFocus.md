## CLEAR_FOCUS

```c
// 0x31B73D1EA9F01DA2
void CLEAR_FOCUS();
```

```
The game focus is used for loading map data, collisions, object population etc. If this has been overridden by script, it is important to clear it afterwards

Clears the overridden game focus and sets it to the player ped again (default)
```
