## SET_VEHICLE_LOD_MULTIPLIER

```c
// 0x93AE6A61BE015BF1
void SET_VEHICLE_LOD_MULTIPLIER(Vehicle vehicle, float multiplier);
```

Sets a lod multiplier for the given vehicle. Start by using low values (1.1, 1.5, etc) until the wanted result is achieved. Large values are not appropriate and will be expensive!
