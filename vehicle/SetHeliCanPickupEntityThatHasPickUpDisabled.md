## SET_HELI_CAN_PICKUP_ENTITY_THAT_HAS_PICK_UP_DISABLED

```c
// 0x94A68DA412C4007D
void SET_HELI_CAN_PICKUP_ENTITY_THAT_HAS_PICK_UP_DISABLED(bool canPickUp);
```

Entities can now be flagged to prevent them being picked up by the cargobob, setting this flag to true will still allow this cargobob to pick them up
