## SWITCH_TRAIN_TRACK

```c
// 0xFD813BB7DB977F20
void SWITCH_TRAIN_TRACK(int iTrackIndex, bool SwitchOn);
```

If you don't switch tracks back off, they will be automatically switched off when your script terminates

You'll need to speak with John to find out which track is which in-game

Toggles whether random trains are created for the specified train track
