```c

void SET_ACTIVATE_OBJECT_PHYSICS_AS_SOON_AS_IT_IS_UNFROZEN(Object object, bool ActivatePhysicsWhenUnfrozen);
```

```
Turns on the object's physics as soon as the collision is loaded around it.

his could be useful if you have created the object on a slope and you need it to lie properly on the slope rather than hover horizontally above the ground.
