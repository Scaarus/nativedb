## FORCE_ACTIVATE_PHYSICS_ON_UNFIXED_PICKUP

```c
// 0x4C134B4DF76025D0
void FORCE_ACTIVATE_PHYSICS_ON_UNFIXED_PICKUP(Object object, bool force);
```

```
HACK FIX FOR SMUGGLER PACK Sets a flag on portable pickup to force it to not fix when dropped. It will force pickup not to snap to ground but gets dropped instead

USE FORCE_ACTIVATE_PHYSICS_ON_DROPPED_PICKUP_NEAR_SUBMARINE instead!
```
