## SET_PICKUP_TRANSPARENT_WHEN_UNCOLLECTABLE

```c
// 0x858EC9FD25DE04AA
void SET_PICKUP_TRANSPARENT_WHEN_UNCOLLECTABLE(Pickup pickup, bool Set);
```

```
Partly alpha's out the pickup object if the pickup is marked uncollectable for the local player by script (or if it is uncollectable due to being a team pickup)
```
