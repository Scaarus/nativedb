## REACTIVATE_ALL_WORLD_BRAINS_THAT_ARE_WAITING_TILL_OUT_OF_RANGE

```c
// 0x0B40ED49D7D6FF84
void REACTIVATE_ALL_WORLD_BRAINS_THAT_ARE_WAITING_TILL_OUT_OF_RANGE();
```

```
This command was added to help with debugging the brain scripts. All world point brains that are waiting for the player to move out of range will be immediately set back to the active state.
```
