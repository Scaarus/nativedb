## REACTIVATE_ALL_OBJECT_BRAINS_THAT_ARE_WAITING_TILL_OUT_OF_RANGE

```c
// 0x4D953DF78EBF8158
void REACTIVATE_ALL_OBJECT_BRAINS_THAT_ARE_WAITING_TILL_OUT_OF_RANGE();
```

```
This command was added to help with debugging the brain scripts. All object brains that are waiting for the player to move out of range will be immediately set back to the active state.
```
