## FORCE_VEHICLE_CAM_STUNT_SETTINGS_THIS_UPDATE

```c
// 0x0AA27680A0BD43FA
void FORCE_VEHICLE_CAM_STUNT_SETTINGS_THIS_UPDATE();
```

```
Force a group of settings for the vehicle camera to avoid confusing cameras during certain stunts. Similar to the USE_VEHICLE_CAM_STUNT_SETTINGS_THIS_UPDATE() but is activating the stunt cameras always without trying to detect if a stunt is in place.
```
