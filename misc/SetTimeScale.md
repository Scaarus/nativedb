## SET_TIME_SCALE

```c
// 0x1D408577D440E81E
void SET_TIME_SCALE(float fNewTimeScale);
```

Sets the time scale of the game to make it run slower.

This command will probably only be of use in cut scenes. For a slow motion effect, try setting NewTimeScale to 0.5. Remember to set the Time Scale back to this once you have finished with the special effect.
