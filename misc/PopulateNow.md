## POPULATE_NOW

```c
// 0x7472BB270D7B4F3E
void POPULATE_NOW();
```

Makes some changes to core systems to try and improve performance.

e.g. reducing the number of real peds in favour of dummy peds Can you check with Obbe before using this. Has to be called every frame during the slow mission section, please only call It during the specifically slow part (e.g. gunfight) and not hte whole mission.
