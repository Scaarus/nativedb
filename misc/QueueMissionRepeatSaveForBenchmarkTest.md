## QUEUE_MISSION_REPEAT_SAVE_FOR_BENCHMARK_TEST

```c
// 0xEB2104E905C6F2E9
bool QUEUE_MISSION_REPEAT_SAVE_FOR_BENCHMARK_TEST();
```

```
The only difference between this command and QUEUE_MISSION_REPEAT_SAVE() is that this command mentions the PC Benchmark Test (instead of Mission Replays) in its warning screens.
```
