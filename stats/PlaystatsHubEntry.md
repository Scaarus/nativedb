## PLAYSTATS_HUB_ENTRY

```c
// 0x2818FF6638CB09DE
void PLAYSTATS_HUB_ENTRY(struct_hub_entry data);
```

triggers after the player enters a social hub, meaning the Casino Nightclub and the beach party; does not include the After Hours Nightclub (we can look at adding this at a later date if needed)
