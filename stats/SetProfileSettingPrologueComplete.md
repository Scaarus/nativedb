## SET_PROFILE_SETTING_PROLOGUE_COMPLETE

```c
// 0xB475F27C6A994D65
void SET_PROFILE_SETTING_PROLOGUE_COMPLETE();
```

```
Call this when the player completes the Prologue so that they can't get into multiplayer until they've completed the Prologue once. Once this flag has been set in the player's profile, they will be able to get into multiplayer from the Prologue. They could start a new game and enter MP from the Prologue. Or they could delete all their savegames and enter MP when the game starts up.
```
