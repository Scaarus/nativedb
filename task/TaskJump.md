## TASK_JUMP

```c
// 0x0AE4086104E067B1
void TASK_JUMP(Ped ped, bool UsePlayerLaunch, bool DoSuperJump, bool UseFullSuperJumpForce);
```

```
Force a char to jump.

If UsePlayerLaunchForce is TRUE then the ped will use the same launch force as the player. If UsePlayerLaunchForce is FALSE and the ped isnâ€™t the player then the ped will jump using a smaller launch force.
```
