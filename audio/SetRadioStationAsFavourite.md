## SET_RADIO_STATION_AS_FAVOURITE

```c
// 0x4CAFEBFA21EC188D
void SET_RADIO_STATION_AS_FAVOURITE(string radioStationName, bool isFavourite);
```

Mark a radio station as a favourite (by default, all stations are favourites). Setting the flag to false will hide the radio station from the radio wheel
