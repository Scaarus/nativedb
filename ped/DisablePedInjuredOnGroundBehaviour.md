## DISABLE_PED_INJURED_ON_GROUND_BEHAVIOUR

```c
// 0x733C87D4CE22BEA2
void DISABLE_PED_INJURED_ON_GROUND_BEHAVIOUR(Ped ped);
```

```
This command overrides the random injured on ground behavior on the provided ped.

Use this to disable the injured on ground nm behaviour when he dies (note, a headshot will still override this currently).
```
