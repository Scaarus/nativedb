## REQUEST_PED_VEHICLE_VISIBILITY_TRACKING

```c
// 0x2BC338A7B21F4608
void REQUEST_PED_VEHICLE_VISIBILITY_TRACKING(Ped ped, bool trackvehicle);
```

```
When set to true and a ped is in a vehicle the vehicle visibility will be tracked. This doesn't change the results returned by peds that are on foot.

Enable better ped's vehicle during visibility tracking
