## SET_PED_GENERATES_DEAD_BODY_EVENTS

```c
// 0x7FB17BA2E7DECA5B
void SET_PED_GENERATES_DEAD_BODY_EVENTS(Ped ped, bool True);
```

If set to TRUE random peds will treat this ped as dead, reacting shocked. Ped will still generate dead body events when dead if bTrue is set to false. This command needs to be renamed.
