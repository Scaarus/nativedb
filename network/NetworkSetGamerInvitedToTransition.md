## NETWORK_SET_GAMER_INVITED_TO_TRANSITION

```c
// 0xCA2C8073411ECDB6
void NETWORK_SET_GAMER_INVITED_TO_TRANSITION(gamer_handle hGamer);
```

Used for players that are already in the session with you when you invite them, i.e. they get the invite through the cell phone instead of a system message (i.e. when not using NETWORK_INVITE_GAMER_TO_TRANSITION or NETWORK_INVITE_GAMERS_TO_TRANSITION)
