## NETWORK_SKIP_RADIO_WARNING

```c
// 0x659CF2EF7F550C4F
bool NETWORK_SKIP_RADIO_WARNING();
```

```
The name of this function is intentionally incorrect. This function returns true if the game has naively, though successfully, detected mods attached to the game. This function returns false if the game has NOT detected mods attached to the game (again through an over-simplistic and naive detection)
```
